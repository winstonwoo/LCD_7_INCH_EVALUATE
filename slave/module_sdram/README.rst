:description: An SDRAM controller designed for 16 bit read and write access of arbitrary length to external SDRAM at up to 50MHz clock rates. 
:keywords: SDRAM, memory
:boards: XA-SK-SDRAM

An SDRAM controller designed for 16 bit read and write access of arbitrary length at up to 50MHz clock rates. It uses an optimised pinout with address and data lines overlaid along with other pinout optimisations in order to implement 16 bit read/write with up to 13 address lines in just 20 pins. The module currently targets the ISSI 6100 and 6400 SDRAM devices but is easily specialised.
